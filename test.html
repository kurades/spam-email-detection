This month, we’re all going to teach a thing or two!
May signals that the end of the school year is upon us, so why not procrastinate from our papers, assignments and grading by making a Glitch app that…teaches a thing. Whether it’s a tutorial, guides, or fan art about your favorite fun fact, this month we’re building apps that will make others say “today I learned!”

Head to glitch.com/jams right now to learn more about what jams are, how to participate, and see wha tthe community made for past jams - as well as inspiration for this month. Join me this Friday at 2pm Eastern for Glitch Jams Live where I'll be showing off last month's submissions and looking at inspiration for this month!

Happy jamming - we can’t wait to see what you create! 🍓

 See you on glitch.com/jams
